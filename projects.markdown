# Projects

Here is a list of projects I have worked on in the past years.

## jvgs

Mostly during the summer of 2009, I wrote a platform game called
[jvgs](http://jvgs.sf.net/). You can read more about the origin of the game in
[this blogpost](/posts/2009-12-09-jvgs-part-i.html). It has a relatively large
codebase for such a game, because I implemented a subset of the
[SVG specification](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/). Levels and figures are
thus stored in SVG files, which allows me to be more original than the classical
tile-based platform games.

## hakyll

I wanted a custom system for this blog/homepage, so in the autumn of 2009, I
wrote [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), a static site generator in
[Haskell](http://haskell.org/). More information can be found in
[this blogpost](/posts/2009-12-02-a-first-post.html), which I wrote when I
initially released it.
