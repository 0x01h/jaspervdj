**TL;DR**: [Alex Lang] and I recently "finished" a library for dealing with
[dynamic graphs].  The library focuses on the dynamic connectivity problem in
particular, although it can do some other things as well.

The story of this library began with last year's [ICFP
contest](https://icfpcontest2018.github.io/).  For this contest, the goal was to
build a program that orchestrates a number of nanobots to build a specific
[minecraft-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) structure, as efficiently
as possible.  I was in Japan at the time, working remotely from the [Tsuru
Capital](http://www.tsurucapital.com/en/) office, and a group of them decided to
take part in this contest.

I had taken part in the 2017 ICFP contest with them, but this year I was not
able to work on this at all since the ICFP contest took place in the same
weekend as my girlfriends' birthday.  We went to Fujikawaguchiko instead --
which I would recommend to anyone interested in visiting the Fuji region.  I
ended up liking it more than Hakone, where I was a year or two ago.

Anyway, after the contest we were discussing how it went and Alex thought a key
missing piece for them was a specific algorithm called _dynamic connectivity_.
Because this is not a trivial algorithm to put together, we ended up using a
less optimal version which still contained some bugs.  In the weeks after the
contest ended Alex decided to continue looking into this problem and we ended up
putting this library together.

The dynamic connectivity problem is very simply explained to anyone who is at
least a little familiar with graphs.  It comes down to building a datastructure
that allows adding and removing edges to a graph, and being able to answer the
question "are these two vertices (transitively) connected" at any point in time.

This might remind you of the _union-find_ problem.  [Union-find], after all, is
a good solution to _incremental_ dynamic connectivity.  In this context,
_incremental_ means that edges may only be added, not removed.  A situation
where edges may be added and removed is sometimes referred to as _fully_ dynamic
connectivity.

[Union-find]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure

Like union-find, there is unfortunately no known persistent version of this
algorithm.  An attempt was made [to create a persistent union find] but I don't
think we can consider this successful in the Haskell sense of purity since the
structure proposed in that paper is inherently not thread-safe; which is one of
the reasons to pursue persistence in the first place.

Anyway, this is why the library currently only provides a mutable interface.
The library uses the `PrimMonad` from the
[primitive](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/primitive) library to ensure you
can use our code both in `IO` and `ST`, where the latter lets us reclaim purity.

Let's walk through a simple example of using the library in plain `IO`.

> import qualified Data.Graph.Dynamic.Levels as GD
> import qualified Data.Tree                 as T
>
> main :: IO ()
> main = do
>     graph <- GD.empty'

Let's consider a fictional map of Hawaiian islands.

>     mapM_ (GD.insert_ graph)
>         ["Akanu", "Kanoa", "Kekoa", "Kaiwi", "Onakea"]
>     GD.link_ graph "Akanu" "Kanoa"
>     GD.link_ graph "Akanu" "Kaiwi"
>     GD.link_ graph "Akanu" "Onakea"
>     GD.link_ graph "Kaiwi" "Onakea"
>     GD.link_ graph "Onakea" "Kanoa"
>     GD.link_ graph "Kanoa" "Kekoa"

![Visualisation of the graph](/images/2019-01-11-illustration-01.png)

The way the algorithm works is by keeping a [spanning forest] at all times.
That way we can quickly answer _connectivity questions_: if two vertices belong
to the same tree (i.e., they share the same root), they are connected.

[spanning forest]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree

![Spanning forest in blue](/images/2019-01-11-illustration-02.png)

For example, can we take ferries from Kaiwi to Kekoa?  The following statement
prints `True`.

>     GD.connected graph "Kaiwi" "Kekoa" >>= print

Such a question, however, could have been answered by a simpler algorithm such
as _union find_ which we mentioned before.  Union find is more than appropriate
if edges can only be added to a graph, but it cannot handle cases where we want
to delete edges.  Let's do just so:

>     GD.cut_ graph "Kaiwi" "Akanu"

![One edge has been cut, spanning forest is the same](/images/2019-01-11-illustration-03.png)

In a case such as the one above, where the deleted edge is not part of the
spanning forest, not much interesting happens, and the overall connectivity is
not affected in any way.

However, it gets interesting when we delete an edge that is part of the spanning
tree.  When that happens, we kick off a search to find a _"replacement edge"_ in
the graph that can restore the spanning tree.

>     GD.cut_ graph "Onakea" "Akanu"

![Two edges have been cut, spanning forest updated](/images/2019-01-11-illustration-04.png)

In our example, we can replace the deleted _Akanu - Onakea_ edge with the _Kanoa
- Onakea_ edge.  Finding a replacement edge is unsurprisingly the hardest part
of the problem, and a sufficiently effecient algorithm was only described in
1998 by Holm, de Lichtenberg and Thorup in
[this paper](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~liamr/p723-holm.pdf).

The algorithm is a little complex, but the paper is well-written, so I'll just
stick with a very informal and hand-wavey explanation here:

-   If an edge is cut from the spanning forest, then this turns one spanning
    tree in the forest into two components.

-   The algorithm must consider all edges in between these two components to
    find a replacement edge.  This can be done be looking at the all the edges
    adjacent to the _smaller_ of the two components.

-   Reasonable amortized complexity, _O(logÂ² n)_, is achieved by "punishing"
    edges that are considered but not taken, so we will consider them less
    frequently in subsequent calls.

Back to our example.  When we go on to delete the _Onakea - Kanoa_ edge, we
cannot find a replacement edge, and we are left with a spanning forest with two
components.

>     GD.cut_ graph "Onakea" "Kanoa"

![Two disconnected spanning trees](/images/2019-01-11-illustration-05.png)

We can confirm this by asking the library for the spanningforest and then using
the very handy `drawForest` from `Data.Tree` to visualize it:

>     GD.spanningForest graph >>= putStr . T.drawForest

This prints:

    Kanoa
    |
    +- Akanu
    |
    `- Kekoa

    Onakea
    |
    `- Kaiwi

Let's restore connectivity to leave things in proper working order for the
residents of our fictional island group, before closing the blogpost.

>     GD.link_ graph "Akanu" "Kaiwi"

For finishing words, what are some future directions for this library?  One of
the authors of the original paper, M. Thorup, wrote a [follow-up] that improves
the theoretical space and time complexity a little.  This seems to punish us
with bad constant factors in terms of time performance -- but it is probably
still worth finishing because it uses significantly less memory.  Contributions,
as always, are welcome.  :-)
