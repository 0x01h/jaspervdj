# Presentations in the terminal

At [work], I frequently need to give (internal) presentations and demos using
video conferencing.  I prefer to do this in the terminal for a few reasons:

- I don't spend time worrying about layout, terminal stuff always looks cool
- I want to write markdown if possible
- You can have a good _"Questions?"_ slide just by running `cowsay 'Questions?'`
- Seamless switching between editor/shell and presentation using [TMUX]

The last point is important for video conferencing especially.  The software we
use allows you to share a single window from your desktop.  This is pretty neat
if you have a multi-monitor setup.  However, it does not play well with
switching between a PDF viewer and a terminal.

# Introducing patat

To this end, I wrote [patat] -- **P**resentations **A**nd **T**he **A**NSI
**T**erminal -- because I was not entirely happy with the available solutions.
You can get it from [Hackage].

The key features are:

- **Built on Pandoc**:

    The software I was using before contained some Markdown parsing bugs.  By
    using [Pandoc] under the hood, this should not happen.

    Additionally, we get all the input formats Pandoc supports ([Literate
    Haskell] is of particular importance to me) and some additional elements
    like tables and definition lists.

- **Smart slide splitting**:

    Most Markdown presentation software seems to split slides at `---`
    (horizontal rulers).  This is a bit verbose since you usually start each
    slide with an `h1` as well.  `patat` will check if `---` is used and if it's
    not, it will split on `h1`s instead.

- **Live reload**:

    If you run `patat --watch presentation.md`, `patat` will poll the file for
    changes and reload automatically.  This is really handy when you are writing
    the presentation, I usually use it with split-pane in `tmux`.

An example of a presentation is:

# How patat came to be

I started writing a simple prototype of `patat` during downtime at [ICFP2016],
when I discovered that [MDP] was not able to parse my presentation correctly.

After ICFP, I flew to Myanmar, and I am currently traveling around the country
with my girlfriend.  It's a super interesting place to visit, with a [rich
history].  Now that [NLD] is the ruling party, I think it is a great time to
visit the country responsibly.

However, it is a **huge** country -- the largest in south-east Asia, so there is
a lot of downtime traveling on domestic flights, buses and boats.  So I
thought it was a good idea to improve the tool a bit further, since I think it
might come in useful for other people as well.

Pull requests are welcome as always!

_Sidenote_: _"Patat"_ is the Flemish word for "potato".  Dutch people also use
it to refer to French Fries but I don't really do that -- in Belgium we just
call fries _"Frieten"_.
