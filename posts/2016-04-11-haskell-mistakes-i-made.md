A week or two ago, I gave a talk at the [Zurich Haskell Meetup] about Haskell
mistakes I have made in the past, and how you can fix them. The slides can be
found [here], and you can watch the talk below, thanks to Simon Meier's prowess
as a cameraman. I'm just glad I managed to strike a great pose in the video
thumbnail.
