# Introduction

I am one of the main organizers of [ZuriHac](https://zurihac.info/), and last
year, we wrote our own registration system for the event in Haskell.  This
blogpost explains why we decided to go this route, and we dip our toes into its
design and implementation just a little bit.

I hope that the second part is especially useful to less experienced Haskellers,
since it is a nice example of small but useful standalone application.  In fact,
this was more or less an explicit side-purpose of the project: I worked on this
together with Charles Till to mentor him a bit in day-to-day practical Haskell
code.

In theory, it should also be possible to reuse this system for other conferences
-- not too much of it ZuriHac specific, and it's all open source.

# Why?

Before 2019; ZuriHac registration worked purely based on Google tools and manual
labor:

 -  Google Forms for the registration form
 -  Google Sheets to manage the registrants, waitlist, T-Shirt numbers, ...
 -  Google Groups to contact registrants

Apart from the fact that the manual labor wasn't scaling above roughly 300
people, there were a number of practical issues with these tools.  The biggest
issue was managing the waiting list and cancellations.

You see, ZuriHac is a free conference, which means that the barrier to signing
up for it is (intentionally and with good reason!) extremely low.
Unfortunately, this will always result in a significant amount of people who
sign up for the event, but do not actually attend.  We try compensating for that
by overbooking and offering cancellations; but sometimes it turns out to be hard
to get people to cancel as well -- especially if it's hard to reach them.

Google Groups is not great for the purpose we're using it for: first of all,
attendees actually need to go and accept the invitation to join the group.
Secondly, do you need a Google Account to join?  I still don't know and have
seen conflicting information over the years.  Anyway, it's all a bit ad-hoc and
confusing.

So one of the goals for the new registration system (in addition to reducing
work on our side) was to be able to track participant numbers better and improve
communication.  We wanted to work with a downloadable ticket; or with an
explicit confirmation that you're attending the event.

I looked into a few options (eventbrite, eventlama, and others...) but none of
of these ticked all the boxes: aside from being free (since we have limited
budget), the privacy of our attendees and some sort of JSON or CSV export option
were very important to us.

Furthermore, what kind of a Haskell conference would we be if we can't even be
bothered to write some Haskell?  So, I decided to solve this problem the same
the way I usually solve problems: write some Haskell code.

# How?

The ZuriHac Registration system ([zureg]) is a "serverless" application that
runs on AWS.  It was designed to fit almost entirely in the free tier of AWS;
which is why I, for example, picked DynamoDB over a database that's actually
nice to use.  We used Brendan Hay's excellent and extensive [amazonka]
libraries to talk to AWS.

[zureg]: https://github.com/zfoh/zureg
[amazonka]: http://brendanhay.nz/amazonka-comprehensive-haskell-aws-client

The total cost of having this running for a year, including during ZuriHac
itself, totaled up to 0.61 Swiss Francs so I would say that worked out
well price wise.

There are two big parts to the application: a fat lambda [^fat-lambda] function
that provides a number of different endpoints, and a bunch of command line
utilities that talk to the different services directly.

[^fat-lambda]: In serverless terminology, it seems to common to refer to lambdas
    that deal with more than one specific endpoint or purpose as "fat lambdas".
    I think this distracts from the issue a bit, since it's more important to
    focus on how the code works and is reusable rather than how it is deployed
    -- but coming from a functional programming perspective I very much enjoy
    the sound of "fat lambda".

However, these are both part of one monolithic codebase which makes it very easy
to share code and ensure all behaviour is consistent -- one big "library" that
has a well-defined module hierarchy and multiple lightweight "executables" is
how I like to design applications in Haskell.

## Building and deploying

First, I'd like to go into how the project is build and compiled.  It's not
great, but I do think it makes a good cookbook of how to do things the hard way.

The main hurdle is that we'll want to run our Haskell code on Lambda, since this
is much cheaper than using an EC2 instance: the server load is very bursty with
long periods (days up to weeks) of complete inactivity.

I wrote a bunch of the zureg code before some Haskell-on-Lambda solutions popped
up, so it is all done from scratch -- and it's surprisingly short.  However, if
I were to start a new project, I would probably use one of these frameworks:

 -  [wai-lambda]( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-lambda)
 -  [serverless-haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/serverless-haskell)
 -  [aws-lambda-haskell-runtime](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws-lambda-haskell-runtime)

Converting zureg to use of these frameworks is something I woulld like to look
into at some point, if I find the time..  The advantage of doing things from
scratch, however, is that it serves the educational purposes of this blogpost
very well!

Our entire serverless framework is currently contained in
[a single 138-line file](https://github.com/zfoh/zureg/blob/38d2374a/lib/Zureg/Serverless.hs).

From a bird's eye view, the building/deployment process looks like this:

 1. We define a
    [docker image](https://github.com/zfoh/zureg/blob/38d2374a/Dockerfile)
    that's based on Amazon Linux -- this ensures we're using the same base
    operating system and system libraries as Lambda, so our binary will work
    there.

 2. We compile our code inside a docker container and copy out the resulting
    executable to the host.

 3. We zip this up together with a
    [python script](https://github.com/zfoh/zureg/blob/38d2374a/deploy/main.py)
    that just forwards requests to the Haskell process.

 4. We upload this zip to S3 and our
    [cloudformation](https://github.com/zfoh/zureg/blob/38d2374a/lib/Zureg/Serverless.hs)
    takes care of setting up the rest of the infrastructure.

I think the current situation is still pretty manageable since the application
is so small; but porting this to something nicer like Nix is definitely on the
table.

## The database

The data model is not too complex.  We're using an event sourcing approach: this
means that our source of truth is really an append-only series of events rather
than a traditional row in a database that we update.  These events are stored as
plain JSON, and we can define them in pure Haskell:

<https://github.com/zfoh/zureg/blob/38d2374a/lib/Zureg/Model.hs>

And then we just have a few handwritten functions in the database module:

<https://github.com/zfoh/zureg/blob/38d2374a/lib/Zureg/Database.hs>

This gives us a few things for free; most importantly if something goes wrong we
can go in and check what events led the user to get into this invalid state.

This code is backed by the [eventful] and [eventful-dynamodb] libraries, in
addition to some custom queries.

[eventful-dynamodb]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/eventful-dynamodb

## The lambda

While our admins can interact with the system using the CLI tooling,
registrants interact with the system using the webapp.  The web application is
powered by a fat
[lambda](https://github.com/zfoh/zureg/blob/38d2374a/lib/Zureg/Main/Lambda.hs).

Using this web app, registrants can do a few things:

 -  Register for the conference (powered by a huge web 1.0 form using
    [digestive-functors](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/digestive-functors));
 -  View their ticket (including a QR code generated by
    [qrcode](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/qrcode);
 -  Confirm their registration;
 -  Cancel their registration.

In addition to these routes used by participants, there's a route used for
ticket scans -- which we'll talk about next.

## The scanning

Now that we have participant tickets, we need some way to process them at the
event itself.

[scanner.js](https://github.com/zfoh/zureg/blob/38d2374a/static/scanner.js) is a
small JavaScript tool that does this for us.  It uses the device's webcam to
scan QR codes -- which is nice because this means we can use either phones,
tablets or a laptop to scan tickets at the event, the device just needs a modern
browser version.  It's built on top of [jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR).

The scanner intentionally doesn't do much processing -- it just displays a
full-screen video of the webcam and searches for a QR code using an external
library.  Once we get a hit for a QR code, we poll the lambda again to retrieve
some information (participant name, T-Shirt size) and overlay that on top of the
video.

![Testing the scanner](/images/2019-09-01-scanner.png)

This is useful because now the people working at the registration desk can see,
as demonstrated in the image above, that I registered too late and thus should
only pick up a T-Shirt on the second day.

# What is next?

There is a lot of room for improvement, but the fact that we had zero technical
issues during registration makes me very happy.  Off the top of my head, here
are some TODOs for next years:

 -  We should have a CRON-style Lambda that handles the waiting list automation
    even further.
 -  It should be easier for attendees to update their information.

Other than that, there are some non-functional TODOs:

 -  Can we make the build/deploy a bit easier?
 -  Should we port zureg to use one of the existing Haskell-on-Lambda
    frameworks?

Any contributions in these areas are of course welcome!

Lastly, there's the question of whether or not it makes sense for other
conferences to use this.  I discussed this briefly with
[Franz Thoma](https://github.com/fmthoma), one of the organizers of
[Munihac](https://munihac.de/2019.html), who expressed similar gripes about
evenbrite.

As it currently stands, zureg is not an off-the-shelf solution and requires some
customization for your event -- meaning it only really makes sense for Haskell
conferences.  On the other hand, there are a good amount of people who prefer
doing this over mucking around in settings dashboard that are hugely complicated
but still do not provide the necessary customization.
