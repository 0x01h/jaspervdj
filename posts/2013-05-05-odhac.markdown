# Introduction

So, last thursday I escaped Belgium for a bit and travelled to [Odessa] to
attend [OdHac], a Haskell Hackathon organised there by [Roman] and hosted by
[Provectus IT].

Odessa is a really sweet city. One thing I noticed is that while some of the
buildings seem to be in a deplorable condition from the outside, they actually
turn out to be very nice once you're indoors! Consider for example the youth
hostel I'm staying in:

I still have some time to explore the city tomorrow (I'm leaving on tuesday),
and I'm really looking forward to that.

# Hakyll at OdHac

I did a small presentation about [Hakyll] on friday, and some awesome people
decided to help me improve Hakyll a bit this weekend. We were able to implement
quite a few features.

## If-else conditionals in templates

We added some functionality to the Hakyll templates which you allows you to
check if a certain value is defined. We chose to use the same syntax as Pandoc,
to further ease integration:

    <h1>$title$</h1>
    $if(author)$
        <em>by $author$</em>
    $endif$

We also support if-else-endif.

## Teasers

Teasers allow you to write a short introduction for a blogpost, and make it easy
to reproduce this introduction on another page together with a "Read more" link.
We decided to implement the convention used in Wordpress, which means you define
your teasers using the following simple format:

    ---
    title: Some post
    ---

    This is the introduction.

    The rest of the post...

## Pagination

We also started to work on a generic Pagination module. This is not finished yet
but it should be possible to clean this up and package it by the end of the
week. I'm quite excited about this feature because lots of people have requested
it in the past.

Additionally, we did some performance improvements and fixed a bug or two. All
in all, a very productive and fun Hackathon! I hope to package up all these
changes and push them to Hackage soon.

Thanks for contributing, Alexey Smirnov, Anton Dubovik, Dmitriy Shamatrin, Ivan
Veselov and Pavel Poukh!
