# Introduction

After [graduating] from [Ghent University] in July and taking a long holiday, I
started my first job, now almost two weeks ago: software engineer at [Erudify]
in Zürich.

# Work at Erudify

There are several reasons why I wanted to work for Erudify. I had a few options
after finishing my studies, some of which were more attractive than others. In
the end I think my criteria were the following (in no particular order):

- I want to code [Haskell] to some extent. I am more productive in Haskell
  compared to other languages, and I also find it more enjoyable. This mostly
  due to the fact that I have been doing some Haskell open source development
  for a long time now.

[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

- This leads me to second criterion: I love the open source community. It is
  important to me that the place I work at has a liberal open source policy.
  We all use free, open source software these days (which tech company doesn not
  run linux on its servers?) and there is no better way to show appreciation
  than to return the favor by releasing great open source libraries.

- I want to improve the world. I really do. Releasing open source libraries is
  one way to do this, but that is usually only a *side effect* of the actual
  work you are doing. I want to *actively* improve the state of the world by
  creating something that actually helps people.

- Europe is my home. I love to travel, but most of my friends are in Europe.
  Visiting people in another European country is fairly cheap and convenient,
  and this is, unfortunately, usually not the case once you are outside of
  Europe.

- Big companies are not my thing -- I hate administration and complex
  hierarchies. When I have a question for someone, I want to just be able to
  walk to their desk and ask them. When I have a suggestion, I want to just be
  able to tell the person in charge. I want to be valued and not just be some
  easily replaceable code-spitting machine.
