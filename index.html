    Hi! I'm Jasper Van der Jeugt. I study Computer Science at Ghent University.
    I was born in 1990, and I'm currently residing in Lokeren &amp; Ghent,
    Belgium. Did I tell you I like to make stuff? I love to make stuff!

    This is a personal, mostly technical blog on various topics including (but
    certainly not limited to) functional programming languages (Haskell!), web
    development, coding and scripting.
