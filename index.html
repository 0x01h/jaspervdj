    Hi! I am Jasper Van der Jeugt. I was born in 1990, and spent most of youth
    in Lokeren &amp; Ghent, Belgium.  Currently, I am a professional
    <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programmer at
    <a href="http://better.com/">Better</a> in ZÃ¼rich. Before that, I studied
    Computer Science at <a href="http://ugent.be/">Ghent University</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Did I tell you I like to make stuff? I love to make stuff! That is why I am
    somewhat active in
    <a href="/cv.html#open-source-projects">open source development</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from that, I have a very broad taste in
    <a href="/recommendations.html#music">music</a> and
    <a href="/recommendations.html#movies">movies</a>,
    and I also enjoy skateboarding and taking
    <a href="/photos.html">pictures</a>.
