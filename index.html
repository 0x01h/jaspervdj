    Hi! I am Jasper Van der Jeugt. I was born in 1990, and spent most of my
    youth in Lokeren &amp; Ghent, Belgium. I currently live in ZÃ¼rich and write
    <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> code for companies
    such as <a href="http://luminal.io/">Luminal</a>,
    <a href="http://bdellium.com/">Bdellium</a> and previously
    <a href="http://better.io/">Better</a>.
    Before that, I studied Computer Science at
    <a href="http://ugent.be/">Ghent University</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Did I tell you I like to make stuff? I love to make stuff! That is why I am
    somewhat active in
    <a href="/cv.html#open-source-projects">open source development</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from that, I have a very broad taste in music and movies, and I also
    enjoy skateboarding and taking <a href="/photos.html">pictures</a>.
