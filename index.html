<p>
    Hi! I'm Jasper Van der Jeugt. I study Computer Science at
    <a href="http://ugent.be/">Ghent University</a>. I was born in 1990, and
    I'm currently residing in Lokeren &amp; Ghent, Belgium. Did I tell you I
    like to make stuff? I love to make stuff! This is why I'm very active in
    open source development, mainly centered around
    <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This is a personal, mostly technical blog on various topics including (but
    certainly not limited to) functional programming languages, web development,
    coding and scripting.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from that, I have a very broad taste in
    <a href="/recommendations.html#music">music</a> and
    <a href="/recommendations.html#movies">movies</a>,
    and I also enjoy running and longboarding.
