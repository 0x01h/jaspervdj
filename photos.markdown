# Photos

I have always been reasonably interested in taking pictures, but this only
really took off in 2012, when I got an entry-level digital camera. A year later,
I got an analog camera as a birthday gift which allowed me to learn even more
about photography and I have been hooked ever since.

Some of my picures are shown on this site, in different categories:
