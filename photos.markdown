I have always been reasonably interested in taking pictures, but this only
really took off in 2012, when I got an entry-level digital camera. A year later,
I got an analog camera as a birthday gift which allowed me to learn even more
about photography and I have been hooked ever since.

I try to organize my photos nicely into different sets:

$for(galleries)$
- [$title$]($url$) - $size$ photos$endfor$

You can also browse them as a photo blog below.
