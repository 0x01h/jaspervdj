## Summary

I am an experienced Haskell developer, which I have been using commercially, for
lots of open source work, and for my studies before that.

I think strong typing and functional programming has helped me achieve a very
rigorous attitude in programming -- not only in Haskell, but also in the other
languages I write such as OCaml, Java, C and C++, JavaScript -- by constantly
striving towards correctness and excellence.

My personal development projects include various libraries written in Haskell,
and a technical blog.

## Skills

**Functional programming**: I have a deep and broad experience with Haskell, as
I have applied it many different areas ranging from High Frequence Trading to
Web Programming.

**Imperative programming**: Problems should be solved in the *right* way. This
means that at many occasions, I have had to dive into low-level and system
programming, which has given me a rigid understanding of C.

**Object-oriented programming**: My experiences with functional languages have
taught me many new and valuable lessons about object-oriented programming and
design. I believe these lessons will be extremely valuable now parallel
programming has become ubiquitous.

**System administration**: For years, I have been using Linux-based operating
systems such as Debian and Archlinux to manage personal servers. This experience
proved very useful when I later learned to manage deployments to multiple
servers using tools such as Ansible, Puppet and NixOps.

**Front end**: As a full-stack engineer, I have also become very fluent with
front-end programming, with e.g. JavaScript (though I prefer TypeScript) and CSS
(though I prefer tools such as LESS).

**Soft skills**: I have a strong Linux background. I am fluent in Dutch and
English, both orally and in writing. I have volunteered in different nonprofits,
so I am confident in my teamwork and organizational skills.

## Work experience

I'll list only relevant jobs here.

- In September 2013, I started as a full-stack Software Engineer at [Better]
  (previously known as *Erudify*). I still work here and love it.

[Better]: http://better.com/

- In 2012, I did a internship as a programmer at [Tsuru Capital LLC], a
  proprietary trading fund based in Tokyo and Singapore. This position taught me
  a lot about desiging large applications on one side, and how to make my code
  run *fast* on the other side.

- I participated in [Google Summer of Code] twice, in 2010 and 2011. In both
  cases, I worked for a Haskell project and was positively evaluated.

[Google Summer of Code]: http://code.google.com/soc/

- In the summer of 2011, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Amplidata]. The job
  involved extending their proprietary Distributed Storage System with an NFS
  frontend, written in [OCaml].

## Open source projects

Since 2009, I have been doing a lot of open source development. This is mostly
centered around the [Haskell] programming language, where I am also actively
involved in the community.

Here is a list of some projects I have worked on in the past years.

- [Lorem Markdownum] (2013): A [lorem ipsum] text generator which generates
  structured [markdown].

[Lorem Markdownum]: http://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum
[lorem ipsum]: http://lipsum.com/
[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

- [stylish-haskell] (2012 - present): A simple tool (and library) for
  formatting [Haskell] code.

[stylish-haskell]: http://github.com/jaspervdj/stylish-haskell

- [websockets] (2011 - present): I created a library for easily writing robust
  WebSocket-capable servers in [Haskell].

[websockets]: http://jaspervdj.be/websockets/

- [Snap Framework] (2011 - present): I am an occasional contributor to this
  [Haskell] web framework.

[Snap Framework]: http://snapframework.com/

- [Text] (2011): I worked on the text library as a [Google Summer of Code]
  student, creating a port which uses UTF-8 internally, and doing extensive
  benchmarking to discover the trade-offs between the different encodings.

[Text]: https://github.com/bos/text

- [blaze-builder] (2010): Simon Meier and I developed an initial version of a
  fast builder monoid for the [BlazeHtml] project. This library is now used in
  many [Haskell] projects. Simon is the current maintainer.

[blaze-builder]: http://github.com/meiersi/blaze-builder/

- [BlazeHtml] (2010 - present) is a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the
  [Haskell] programming language. I worked on this project for [Google Summer of
  Code] 2010.

[BlazeHtml]: http://jaspervdj.be/blaze

- [Hakyll] (2009 - present): I wanted a custom system for my personal homepage,
  so I wrote [Hakyll], a static site generator in [Haskell].

[Hakyll]: http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll
[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

- [Digestive functors] (2010 - present) is a general way of consuming input in
  [Haskell]. It can be used to generate HTML forms and parse the form input, as
  well as command-line applications.

[Digestive functors]: http://github.com/jaspervdj/digestive-functors/

- [geohub.github.com](http://geohub.github.com/) (2012): This is a small tool to
  geolocate your github collaborators.

- [12Urenloop] (2011 - present): With [Zeus WPI], we created software to count
  laps for this yearly [student event](http://12urenloop.be) (Dutch). I
  specifically focused on `count-von-count`, a central component used to process
  raw bluetooth events into useful lap data.

- [JVGS] (2009) is an "artsy" platform game that is not like the others. I
  implemented a subset of the [SVG specification] to give the game it's original
  look.
