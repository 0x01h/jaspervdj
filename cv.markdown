## Projects

Here is a list of projects I have worked on in the past years.

### JVGS (2009)

[JVGS] is an arty platform game that is not like the others. I implemented a
subset of the [SVG specification] to give the game it's original look.

### hakyll (2009 - now)

I wanted a custom system for my personal homepage, so I wrote [Hakyll], a static
site generator in [Haskell].

## Conferences & Meeting attended

### BarcampGhent (2009)

In the autumn of 2009, I attended BarcampGhent, where I gave a presentation
called "Learn You a Haskell in 20 minutes".

### ZuriHac (2010)

I travelled to ZÃ¼rich in March, 2010, to attend ZuriHac, which then was the
largest Haskell Hackaton ever.
