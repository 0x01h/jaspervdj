## Summary

I have a strong interest for and a lot of experience with functional programming
languages, mainly Haskell and OCaml. I am also well-versed in more traditional
programming languages and I have a strong Linux background. I am fluent in Dutch
and English, both orally and in writing. I have volunteered in different
nonprofits, so I am confident in my teamwork and organizational skills.

## Work experience

I'll list only relevant jobs here.

- In 2012, I did a 3-month long full-time programming internship at
  [Tsuru Capital LLC], a proprietary trading fund based in Tokyo and Singapore.

[Tsuru Capital LLC]: http://tsurucapital.com/

- I participated in [Google Summer of Code] twice, in 2010 and 2011. In both
  cases, I worked for a Haskell project and was positively evaluated.

[Google Summer of Code]: http://code.google.com/soc/

- In the summer of 2011, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Amplidata]. The job
  involved extending their proprietary Distributed Storage System with an NFS
  frontend, written in [OCaml].

## Open source projects

Since 2009, I have been doing a lot of open source development. This is mostly
centered around the [Haskell] programming language, where I am also actively
involved in the community.

Here is a list of some projects I have worked on in the past years.

- [websockets] (2011 - present): I created a library for easily writing robust
  WebSocket-capable servers in [Haskell].

[websockets]: http://jaspervdj.be/websockets/

- [Snap Framework] (2011 - present): I am an occasional contributor to this
  [Haskell] web framework.

[Snap Framework]: http://snapframework.com/

- [Text] (2011): I worked on the text library as a [Google Summer of Code]
  student, creating a port which uses UTF-8 internally, and doing extensive
  benchmarking to discover the trade-offs between the different encodings.

[Text]: https://github.com/bos/text

- [blaze-builder] (2010): Simon Meier and I developed an initial version of a
  fast builder monoid for the [BlazeHtml] project. This library is now used in
  many [Haskell] projects. Simon is the current maintainer.

- [BlazeHtml] (2010 - present) is a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the
  [Haskell] programming language. I worked on this project for [Google Summer of
  Code] 2010.

- [Hakyll] (2009 - present): I wanted a custom system for my personal homepage,
  so I wrote [Hakyll], a static site generator in [Haskell].

[Hakyll]: http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll
[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

- [Digestive functors] (2010 - present) is a general way of consuming input in
  [Haskell]. It can be used to generate HTML forms and parse the form input, as
  well as command-line applications.

[Digestive functors]: http://github.com/jaspervdj/digestive-functors/

- [geohub.github.com](http://geohub.github.com/) (2012): This is a small tool to
  geolocate your github collaborators.

- [12Urenloop] (2011 - present): With [Zeus WPI], we created software to count
  laps for this yearly [student event](http://12urenloop.be) (Dutch). I
  specifically focused on `count-von-count`, a central component used to process
  raw bluetooth events into useful lap data.

- [JVGS] (2009) is an "artsy" platform game that is not like the others. I
  implemented a subset of the [SVG specification] to give the game it's original
  look.
