## Projects

Here is a list of projects I have worked on in the past years.

### JVGS (2009)

[JVGS] is an arty platform game that is not like the others. I implemented a
subset of the [SVG specification] to give the game it's original look.

[SVG specification]: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/

### hakyll (2009 - now)

I wanted a custom system for my personal homepage, so I wrote [Hakyll], a static
site generator in [Haskell].

### BlazeHtml (2010 - now)

[BlazeHtml] is a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the [Haskell]
programming language. I worked on this project for [Google Summer of Code] 2010.

### Digestive Functors (2010 - now)

[Digestive functors] is a general way of consuming input in [Haskell]. It can be
used to generate HTML forms and parse the form input, as well as command-line
applications.
