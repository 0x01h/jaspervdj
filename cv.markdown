## Projects

Here is a list of projects I have worked on in the past years.

### JVGS (2009)

[JVGS] is an arty platform game that is not like the others. I implemented a
subset of the [SVG specification] to give the game it's original look.

### hakyll (2009 - now)

I wanted a custom system for my personal homepage, so I wrote [Hakyll], a static
site generator in [Haskell].

### BlazeHtml (2010 - now)
